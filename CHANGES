Fixed compatibility with Forge ModLoader...at least I hope so.


0.10
----

 * Added more options:
   * --demo

This version should add compatibility with Forge ModLoader.


0.9
---

The following parameters are now correctly recognized:
 * --width
 * --height
 * --x
 * --y


0.8
---

 * Added even more options:
   * --x
   * --y
 * Added build-script for ant
 * Fixed hanging/not closable window
 * Fixed possible location issue with --fullscreen

I've tested compatibility with versions through Beta, Alpha back to Indev and was able to launch all versions I got a hold off.

Also, if you don't specify any parameters with this version, it will fall back to your Default-Minecraft install and launch that.


0.7
---

 * Added more options:
   * --fullscreen
   * --always-on-top
   * --additional-jar

Please note that the --additional-jar feature might fail for you, that depends on the mod which tries to load additional classes and the method it uses. It *should* work for most cases.
