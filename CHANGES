1.0
---

 * Replaced internals with MinecraftMiddleKnife
 * As a side effect, it is now easily possible to replace specific lwjgl jars.


0.16.1
------

 * Only providing --parent-dir should now work better.
 * Recompiled jar to be compatible with Java 1.5 and up.


0.16
----

 * Fixed a misleading exception message
 * Added options:
   * --auth-address
   * --opacity
   * --dump
   * --no-exit
   * --applet
   * --blend-with, --blend-jar-name, --blend-keep-manifest


0.15
----

 * Fixed --authentication-failure
 * Added options:
   * --use-lastlogin
   * --save-lastlogin


0.14
----

 * Fixed authentication with e-mail address, that should be replaced with
   the username.
 * Added option:
   * --keep-username


0.13
----

 * Added Mojang Authentication with the following options:
   * --authenticate
   * --authentication-failure
   * --keep-alive
   * --launcher-version


0.12
----

 * Added more options:
   * --options-file
 * Fixed:
   * --set-options works now without --texturepack


0.11
----

Fixed compatibility with Forge ModLoader...at least I hope so.


0.10
----

 * Added more options:
   * --demo

This version should add compatibility with Forge ModLoader.


0.9
---

The following parameters are now correctly recognized:
 * --width
 * --height
 * --x
 * --y


0.8
---

 * Added even more options:
   * --x
   * --y
 * Added build-script for ant
 * Fixed hanging/not closable window
 * Fixed possible location issue with --fullscreen

I've tested compatibility with versions through Beta, Alpha back to Indev and
was able to launch all versions I got a hold off.

Also, if you don't specify any parameters with this version, it will fall back
to your Default-Minecraft install and launch that.


0.7
---

 * Added more options:
   * --fullscreen
   * --always-on-top
   * --additional-jar

Please note that the --additional-jar feature might fail for you, that depends
on the mod which tries to load additional classes and the method it uses.
It *should* work for most cases.


0.6
---

 * Added more options:
   * --set-option=NAME:VALUE
   * --no-frame
   * --session-id=SESSIONID
   * --mppass=MPPASS

   * lwjgl-dir
   * native-dir
